# automatically-indexing-images-with-python
Hello, everyone!
This small project was built to generate images with an index and positioning them on top of a template image automatically, saving quiet some time on placing small text boxes on hundreds of images. It was a task to help with sticker printing the logo and specific number for a company here in Brazil.
Using Python and PIL (Python Imaging Library) I've created a simple way to manage small tasks of a simple human daily needs.
It was a great starter project, not gonna lie.
