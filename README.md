# automatically-indexing-images-with-python
Hello, everyone!
This small project was built to generate images with an index and positioning them on top of a template image automatically, saving quiet some time on placing small text boxes on hundreds of images. It was a task to help with sticker printing the logo and specific number for a company here in Brazil.
Using Python and PIL (Python Imaging Library) I've created a simple way to manage small tasks of a simple human daily needs.
It was a great starter project, not gonna lie.

FUTURE IDEA: building a GUI so that the user can select the base photo that is going to be be used, place where they want the number to be generated and setup the interval of stickers that are going to be created. Besides that, the user can also indicate the font of the number/text they wish to use.
